CMake toolchain files

This directory contains toolchain files for cross-compiling with CMake. These
files are written for toolchains installed on Debian 12 (Bookworm) from the
repositories. If you install toolchains from another distrobution, operating
system, or build them yourself then these files will probably have to be
modified.

Documentation on cross-compiling with CMake can be found here:
