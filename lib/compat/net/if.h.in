/* TODO: It should be possible to implement a POSIX-like net/if.h interface on
   Windows. It seems Windows has a lot of these functions with different
   function prototypes and such. See here for a start:
     https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/netioapi/nf-netioapi-if_indextoname
   More functions can probably be found in 'Iphlpapi.lib'
