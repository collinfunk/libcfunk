This folder contains header file templates for system/libc header files. These
files are not replacements of system headers. They only declare functions that
are missing on the host system. This requires the use of the "#include_next"
preprocessor directive with gcc or clang. This is also supported by at least
the current versions of pcc and tcc in Debian Bookworm. This is not portable
though and should be changed in the future.

If a compiler does not support "#include_next" then the absolute path to a
header file can be used. This can probably be done with CMake. Paths in
build-systems should not be hard-coded to "/usr/include" for example though,
as this would make cross-compiling break.
