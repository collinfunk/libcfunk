/* This file defines _Exit which is specified by C99. This is equivalent to
   the _exit function which is specified by POSIX. However, _Exit cannot be
   implemented using the exit (no underscore). Both _Exit and _exit do not call
   functions registered with atexit nor any registered signal handlers. It is
   implementation defined whether open file streams are closed with or without
   flushing. This behavior differs from exit which is required to call all
   functions registered by atexit before flushing all open streams with
   unwritten data. */
